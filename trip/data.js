   Japan Study Tour 2026 — content
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The teacher edits THIS file. Nothing here is code you have to understand: it is
   lists of things with labels on them. index.html never needs touching to add
   a sight, a spot or a phrase.

   Conventions, fixed by the teacher:
     - Instructions and body copy in English. Students are Years 8-11.
     - Headings bilingual, JAPANESE FIRST, then English.
     - Every spot ends with a "look" line: something to go and do, so the phone
       sends them back to the real thing instead of holding them.
     - AU spelling. No em dashes in anything a student reads.
     - `photo` is a filename in this folder, or null. Null renders a labelled
       placeholder, so the app works today and improves when photos land.

      j: "You have now been inside two Japanese schools. Write what you think school is for here, then what you think it is for at home. You are allowed to be unsure, and saying so is better than pretending." },

She is on her way to work, and many of those side streets are private property where you cannot take photos at all. In a crowd, do not stop dead to talk or take a picture, and do not spread out four abreast, which a group of fourteen does without noticing. Use a bin or carry your rubbish, and smoke only in a marked smoking area. On trains and buses, keep your voice down, do not take calls, and give up your seat.",
