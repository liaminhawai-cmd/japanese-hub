/* ============================================================================
   phrases.js — what to say about the one image, and what to say when the
   question gets away from you.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six groups. The first is the doorway script the specifications require and
   do not assess. The next four build the Discussion from describing the image
   up to evaluating the practice. The last is the repair strategies that four
   of the six assessor reports name.

   A phrase with ＿＿ in it reads badly aloud, so those carry `say`: the same
   phrase with the blank filled in. The audio button speaks `say` when it is
   there and `ja` when it is not, and the app shows the filled version as a
   worked example underneath.

   Japanese here uses only the 200 prescribed kanji, with readings stored as
   漢字[かんじ]. 写真 is not on the list, so a photo is しゃしん throughout.

   The object below is pure JSON. The single `window.` line is the only
   JavaScript in the file.
