/* flow.js — the shape of the examination, from the flow sheet Andrew's
   students are drilled on.

   This file exists because the timed run used to shuffle everything. Andrew,
   4 October 2026: *"I know I asked for randomisation but some parts of the
   exam have to go in a particular order."* They do, and getting the order
   wrong teaches the wrong thing:

     the topic is named on the way in, before Section 1, which is exactly
     why Section 1 never touches it;
     Section 1 opens on one of six predictable questions and works through
     your own world, then Japanese study, then your contact with Japanese
     culture;
     Section 2 opens on a definition, and only then fans out.

   So randomisation happens inside a phase and never across phases.

   The entry and exit scripts are not assessed and are not optional. They are
   here because they are the first and last thing the assessors hear, and
   because an app that drills eight minutes of discussion and skips
   「しつれいします」 is teaching the wrong examination.

   `section2.moves` is the other half of Andrew's answer to a problem no
   app without AI can solve: it cannot work out what to ask next, so the
   student says. The moves are the directions a real assessor goes, in the
   order they go in, and the student picks one while the clock runs. That is
   also the skill — steering the questioning towards what you researched is
   something the flow sheet teaches explicitly.

   `ui` holds the lines the app itself speaks rather than quotes: at the
   moment just the one the speed button plays. It lives here so that the
   recorder records it. It used to be written into index.html, which meant
   nothing recorded it and it was the one line in the whole app still read
   by the device's own voice.

   One window. line, then pure JSON. No comments inside the object.       */
