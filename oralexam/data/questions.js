/* ============================================================================
   questions.js — the question bank for the VCE Japanese Second Language oral
   examination.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Section 1, Conversation: questions about the student's own world and about
   their own contact with Japanese language and culture, across ten topic areas
   and all six question types.

   Section 2, Discussion: the questions never name a subtopic, because every
   student brings their own. They are grouped by the stage of the discussion
   they belong to, and their model answers are written against one worked
   example (わがし) so they have something concrete to show; `model_topic` names it.
   Five further worked subtopics are in `topic_sets`.

   Japanese in this file uses only the 200 kanji prescribed by the VCE Japanese
   Second Language Study Design (From 2020), page 14. Any word whose normal
   spelling needs a kanji outside that list is written in hiragana, so
   写真 is しゃしん, 文化 is ぶんか and 将来 is しょうらい. Every kanji carries its
   reading in the form 漢字[かんじ], stored here rather than generated at run
   time, and tools/validate.js re-checks both rules on every change.

   report_refs quote the VCE assessor reports 2020–2025, which are the source
   for the examiner tips in the app; the full set is in report_insights.js.

   The object below is pure JSON. The single `window.` line is the only
   JavaScript in the file.
